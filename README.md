Skeleton
========

##sengeezer fork

This an upward fork of the original Skeleton that includes SCSS instead of CSS and respond.js to support laggards.

This version also gets rid of the excessive comments in the original to produce more professional friendly code.

Now that an official SASS port exists, I will look to merge the advantages of this fork into a fresh fork of [the port](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass)
