Skeleton
========

##sengeezer fork

This an upward fork of the original Skeleton that includes SCSS instead of CSS and polyfills to support laggards.

This version also gets rid of the excessive comments in the original to produce more professional friendly code.

**Note:** The above will apply once v1 is out.
